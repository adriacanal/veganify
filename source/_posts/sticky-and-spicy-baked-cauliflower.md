No need to deal with a pot of hot oil to get crispy battered cauliflower. These oven-baked florets come out crackly and just rich enough before getting bathed in a sticky-sweet gochujang glaze.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
- ½ cup cornstarch
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
- 1 large head of cauliflower (about 2½ lb.), cut into large florets
- ¼ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 3 Tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup
- 2 Tbsp. mirin
- 2 tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°. Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl to combine. Whisk in 1 cup water to create a thin pancake-like batter (you may need to add more water to achieve the right consistency). Using your hand or 2 forks and working one at a time, dip cauliflower florets into batter, letting excess drip back into bowl, and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cauliflower until edges are just beginning to turn golden brown, 20–25 minutes.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, whisk gochujang, soy sauce, maple syrup, mirin, and 1 cup water in a medium bowl. Pour sauce into a skillet large enough to hold all of the cauliflower florets (a 12" skillet should do it) and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally. Cook, whisking, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Stir in vinegar and remove pan from heat.

### Step 3

Using tongs, transfer cauliflower to skillet with glaze and toss until florets are evenly coated in sauce.

### Step 4

Divide rice among shallow bowls and spoon cauliflower over. Top with sesame seeds and scallions.
