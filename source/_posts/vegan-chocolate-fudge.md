This 2-ingredient vegan chocolate fudge recipe would make a really good dessert option if you have guests coming over and don’t have much time to spend on making a complicated sweet treat.

## Ingredients
- 100g dark chocolate, broken up into small pieces
- 120ml (1/2 cup) almond butter or tahini
– 1 tbsp maple syrup or to taste (Optional)

## Method
Use the double boiler method to melt the chocolate – fill a small saucepan 1/4 way up with water. Heat over a high heat until the water boils, then lower the heat and allow to simmer gently. Place a small heat-proof bowl on top ensuring the the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Add the chocolate pieces along with the almond butter and optional maple syrup. Mix until everything is melted and well combined.
Pour the mixture into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper, or silicon chocolate moulds (I used this one).
Leave to chill in the fridge until set. 
Store in the fridge in an air tight container. 
Enjoy!
