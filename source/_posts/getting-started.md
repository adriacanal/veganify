Getting started with Veganify

### Adding Content

You can write your content using a Markdown file. By default, the project expects your content to be located in the `source/_posts/` folder.

The top of each content page contains a YAML header that specifies how it should be rendered. The `title` attribute is used to dynamically generate HTML `title` and OpenGraph tags for each page. The `extends` attribute defines which parent Blade layout this content file will render with (e.g. `_layouts.post` will render with `source/_layouts/post.blade.php`), and the `section` attribute defines the Blade "section" that expects this content to be placed into it.
